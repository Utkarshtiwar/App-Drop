# AppDrop - Dynamic Widget Rendering Engine (Flutter)

## Overview
This Flutter project implements a small "schema → UI" engine: a Flutter app that renders an entire page from a JSON description. It supports:
- Image Banner
- Image Carousel
- Image Grid
- Video Player
- Text Block

All UI is generated from JSON; there is no hardcoded layout.
